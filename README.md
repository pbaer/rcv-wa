## Analysis of Ranked-Choice Voting Impact on WA Elections

Washington State has used a [Top 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary) primary since 2008:

> The two candidates who receive the most votes in the Primary Election qualify for the General Election. A candidate must also receive at least 1% of the votes cast in that race to advance to the General Election.

Sometimes, the top two candidates in a primary don't receive a majority of the votes cast, in which case most of the people voting in the primary do not get the opportunity to vote for their chosen candidate in the general election.

This is rare: it has happened in only 8 out of 1,004 primary races in Washington since Top 2 was introduced. And in most of those cases, the two candidates advancing to the general belonged to different parties, so voters were at least able to vote for their preferred party, if not for their preferred candidate.

However, there has been at least one case where the top two primary finishers belonged to the same party *and* together received less than 50% of the vote:

```
2016/08/02 - State Treasurer
Top 2 had 48.42% of the vote:
  Duane Davidson (R): 25.09 | 58.15
  Michael Waite (R): 23.33 | 41.85
  Marko Liias (D): 20.36
  John Paul Comerford (D): 17.97
  Alec Fisken (D): 13.24
Party share:
  (Prefers Democratic Party): 51.57
  (Prefers Republican Party): 48.42
```

In this case, even though Democrats captured well over 51% of the total primary vote share, no Democrat made it to the general, because the three Democrats split the vote and spoiled the chance for any of them to advance.

   I was curious what difference it might make to adopt [Ranked-Choice Voting
